# Setup

- Install bun: https://bun.sh/
- Run `bun install` in the project root

# Running Problem Solutions
Advent of code is separated into "days", where each day is typically a two-part challenge.

These live inside the numbered directories in the repo (1, 2, 3, etc). Check the readme inside each for specific instructions. Generally, you'll plop your input file into the day's directory and `bun index.ts` or similar.
