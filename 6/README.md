# Advent of Code 2025 - Day 6
https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/6

# Setup
Download https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/6/input and place it into this folder named `input` (no extension).

My input is already included in the repository, feel free to replace it with your own.

# Running
- From the project root, run `bun run 6`
- From this directory, run `bun index.ts`

To run the example from the day 5 instructions, pass `--example` (`-e`) as an argument: `bun run 6 --example` or `bun index.ts --example`. The solutions for the included example should be `4277556` and `3263827`.

# Checking output
The puzzle solutions are output directly to stdout.

~~To log the full algorithmic representation of each iteration of part 2, pass the `--log` (`-l`) flag:
- `bun run 6 --log` (from project root)
- `bun run index.ts --log` (from this directory)

You can use the log with the `--example` flag as well.~~
